                <p>We're living in a time of unprecedented economic, political, and social hardships. And that's why knowing key issues has become more critical than ever. However, in the era of digital journalism, it's difficult to get clear information about things that would affect our daily lives. In a flood of stories and fake news, our aim is to help people understand issues in an easy and clear way.</p>
                
                <p>On THISISALLABOUT, our aim is to unravel complex issues and agendas by group, timeframe, and key topic using intelligent data analysis and great visualization. And with a delicate touch on curation, we help you navigate through a wide range of issues by a single click. Furthermore, our algorithm analyzes without the possibility of political biases (see more about how it works below), which fundamentally changes the way you read news.</p>
                
                <p>Through a deliberate process of data analysis and story curation, we will never stop discovering every aspect of society. That's what and how we do.</p>
                <p>THISISALLABOUT is not just a news portal or an assistant. It's all about things that really matter.</p>

            Automatically aggregates stories from major news publishers every hour. During this process, it filters out words that are not important or too common in general (such as "of").

            To analyze a large amount of news data, a clustering unit first vectorizes all word tokens to help the computer comprehend critical information. Then it moves to a clustering processor. 
            </li>
            <li>
            The clustering processor groups news stories by a set of clusters with stories similar to each other.

            <li>
            Lastly, the unit reorganizes the clusters with some stories most relevant to the topic of each cluster.
