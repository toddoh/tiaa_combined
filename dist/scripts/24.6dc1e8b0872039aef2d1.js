                <p>We are living in a time of unprecedented economic, political, and social hardships. That's why having a data driven perspective on key issues has become more critical than ever.</p>
                <p>However, in the era of digital journalism, it's difficult to get clear information about what is affecting our daily lives. In a flood of stories and fake news, our aim is to help people understand issues in an easy, and clear way.</p>
